## Do you need support?

Details about support for the project can be found here on the Wiki. You may also wish to use
the [Subreddit](https://reddit.com/r/Dynmap/) or the [Discord](https://discord.gg/52pqBpw) to get support. Templates for
asking support can be found in each location.

## Have you found a bug?

Before reporting a bug or issue, please make sure you can replicate the issue and that the issue is directly related to
the main dynmap branch (not one of the forks like dynmap-essentials, dynmap-blockscanner, etc) If so, please submit bug
reports **ONLY TO THIS GITHUB** with the title `[BUG REPORT] Bug Report Title`

## Contributing to Dynmap's Code?

The Dynmap team welcomes Pull Requests with fixes, new features, and new platform support. That said, the following
rules apply:

- Ultimately, we reserve the right to accept or deny a PR for any reason: fact is, by accepting it, we're also accepting
  any of the problems with supporting it,
  explaining it to users, and fixing current and future problems - if we don't think the PR is of value consistent with
  that cost, we'll probably not accept it.
- All PRs should be as small as they can be to accomplish the feature or fix being supplied. To that end:
    - Do not lump multiple features into one PR - you'll be asked to split them up before they will be reviewed or
      accepted
    - Do not make style changes, reflow code, pretty printing, or otherwise make formatting-only code changes. This
      makes the PR excessively large,
      creating changes to be reviewed that don't actually do anything (but we have to review them to be sure they aren't
      being used to disguise security
      compromises or other malicious code), and they create problems with the MANY people who fork Dynmap for the sake
      of doing PRs or their own private
      custom builds - since all theose modified lines create merge conflicts - once again, with no actual function
      having been accomplished. If we decide
      the code needs to be 'prettied up', it'll be done by the Dynmap team.
- Do not make changes to core code (anything in DynmapCore or DynmapCoreAPI) unless you're ready to build and test it on
  all supported platforms. Code that
  breaks building of ANY supported platform will be rejected.
- Likewise, any Spigot related changes are expected to function correctly on all supported Spigot and PaperMC versions (
  currently 1.10.2 through 1.16.1).
- Do not include any code that involves platform specific native libraries or command line behaviors. Dynmap supports
  32-bit and 64-bit, Windows, lots of
  Linux versions (both x86 and ARM), MacOS, being used in Docker environments, and more - this is all about staying as '
  pure Java' as the Minecraft server itself
  is. If your PR includes platform specific dependencies that are not coded to handle working on all the above platforms
  properly, the PR will be rejected.
- Dynmap's code is Apache Public License v2 - do not include any code that is not compatible with this license. By
  contributing code, you are agreeing to
  that code being subject to the APL v2.
- Do not include any code that unconditionally adds to Dynmap's hosting requirements - for example, support for a
  database can be added, but the use of the
  database (which likely depends on a database server being deployed and configured by the user) cannot become an
  unconditional requirement in order to run
  Dynmap. Features can add the option to exploit new or additional technologies, but cannot add unconditionally to the
  minimum requirements on the supported
  platforms (which is what is needed to run the corresponding MC server, plus the Dynmap plugin or mod)
- Dynmap is built and supports running on Java 8 - it can run on newer versions, but any contributed code and
  dependencies MUST support being compiled and run
  using just Java 8.
- Don't introduce other language dependencies - Java only: no Kotlin, Scala, JRuby, whatever. They just add runtime
  dependencies that most of the platforms lack,
  and language skills above and beyond the Java language requirements the code base already mandates, which just creates
  obstacles to other people contributing.
- Similarly, do not update existing libraries and dependencies - these are often tied to the versions on various
  platforms, and updates will likely break runtime
- Do not include code specific to other plugins or mods. Dynmap has APIs for the purpose of avoiding the problem of
  working with other mods - there are many
  'Dynmap-XXX' mods and plugins which use the APIs to provide support for other mods and plugins (WorldGuard, Nucleus,
  Citizens, dozens of others). Maintaining
  interfaces in Dynmap particular to dozens of mods on multiple versions of multiple platforms is unmanageable, so we
  don't do it. The ONLY exception currently
  are security mods - although, even for those, leverage of platform-standard security interfaces is always preferred (
  e.g. Sponge or Bukkit standard permissions)

## Porting, Supporting Other Platforms, Customized Dynmap Builds

While Dynmap is open source, subject to the Apache Public License, v2, the Dynmap team does have specific policies and
requirements for anyone that would
use the code here for anything except building contributions submitted back to this code base as Pull Requests (which is
the only process by which code is accepted and can become part of a release supported by the Dynmap team). Other
authorized uses include:

- Building custom version of Dynmap for use on a personal or on a specific server, so long as this version is NOT
  distributed to other parties.
  The modifying team agrees to not pursue support from the Dynmap team for this modified private version, but is
  otherwise not required to share the
  modified source code - though doing so is encouraged.
- Building a modified version of Dynmap for otherwise unsupported platforms: in this event, the modified version MUST be
  for a platform or version
  not yet (or no longer) supported by the Dynmap team. If the Dynmap team comes to support this platform or version, the
  modifying team must agree to
  cease distribution of the unofficial version, unless otherwise authorized to continue doing so. Further:
    - The team distributing the modified version must cite the origin of the Dynmap code, but must also clearly indicate
      that the version is NOT supported by
      nor endorsed by the Dynmap team, and that ALL support should be directed through the team providing the modified
      version.
    - Any modified version CANNOT be monetized or otherwise charged for, under any circumstances, nor can redistribution
      of it be limited or restricted.
    - The modified code must continue to be Apache Public License v2, with no additional conditions or restrictions,
      including full public availability of the
      modified source code.
    - Any code from Dynmap used in such versions should be built from an appropriate fork, as DynampCore and other
      components (other than DynmapCoreAPI and
      dynmap-api) are subject to breaking changes at any time, and the support messages in DynmapCore MUST be modified
      to refer to the supporting team (or, at
      least, removed). The modified version should NOT refer to the Dynmap Discord nor to /r/Dynmap on Reddit for
      support. in any case.
    - Any bugs or issues opened in conjunction with the use of the modified version on this repository will be closed
      without comment.

Additions of new functions, including new platform support, in this official Dynmap code base MUST be fully contained
within the PRs submitted to this
repository. Further, it is always expected than any updates will be built and tested across all relevant platforms -
meaning any chances to shared code
components (DynmapCore, DynmapCoreAPI) MUST be successfully built and tested on ALL supported platforms (Forge, Spigot,
etc). Changes which break
supported platforms will be rejected.

The only interfaces published and maintained as 'stable' are the interfaces of the DynmapCoreAPI (cross platform) and
dynmap-api (Bukkit/spigot specific)
libraries. All other components are NOT libraries - DynmapCore, in particular, is a shared code component across the
various platforms, but is subject to
breaking changes without warning or consideration - any use of DynmapCore interfaces by code outside this repository is
NOT supported, and will likely
result in breaking of such consuming code without warning and without apology. DynmapCore is an internal shared code
component, not a library - please
treat it accordingly.

Plugins or mods using the published APIs - DynmapCoreAPI (for all platforms) or dynmap-api (only for Spigot/Bukkit) -
may access these components as
'compile' dependencies: DO NOT INTEGRATE THEM INTO YOUR PLUGIN - this will break Dynmap and/or other plugins when these
interfaces are updated or
expanded. These libraries are published at https://repo.mikeprimm.com and will be updated each official release.
